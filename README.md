# Forecasting Optimal Conditions for Outdoor Activities


## Introduction
In recent years, weather forecasting has become increasingly accurate and reliable, providing valuable information to decision-makers across a range of industries. One area where weather forecasting has become particularly important is in sports, where inclement weather conditions can pose significant risks to player safety and performance. In response to this, a dashboard has been developed to provide analysis on whether a sport can be played or not based on forecasted weather information.

## Objective
The problem is to develop a recommendation system for playing outdoor sports based on the weather conditions forecasted for the next 5 days at 3-hour intervals. The objective is to provide users with accurate and reliable information that can help them decide whether to proceed with a planned outdoor activity or reschedule it due to unfavorable weather conditions.
